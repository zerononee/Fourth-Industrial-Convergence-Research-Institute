With this tutorial, we have a working example website that we will explore together. We'll learn a few rules and look for patterns to get an understanding of what things do. And you can continue to use this website as a reference after the tutorial, along with [**RStudio's instructions for R Markdown websites**](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html).      

We'll start our exploration online looking at the website architecture, then we'll clone the repo to our local computers. Locally, we will explore further by going back and forth between the R Markdown editor and built webpages, and make modifications. Pushing to Github will make our modifications live!
